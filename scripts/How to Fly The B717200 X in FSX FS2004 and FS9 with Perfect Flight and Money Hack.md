To use the money hack, you need to follow these steps:

2. Make a backup copy of the file in case something goes wrong.
3. Open the file with a text editor, such as Notepad.
4. Find the line that says `<Reward id="Money">`.
5. Below that line, find the line that says `<Value>0</Value>`.
6. Edit the value to any amount you want. For example, if you want to have 10 million dollars, change it to `<Value>10000000</Value>`.
7. Save and close the file.
8. Start the game and enjoy flying the **B717-200 X** with unlimited money.

Note: The money hack only works for single-player mode. If you play online or multiplayer mode, your money balance will be reset to zero.
